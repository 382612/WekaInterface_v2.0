###Overview
Klessify is a webapplication that utilizes the Weka API to make machine learning
more approachable to people with little knowledge of machine learning.
With a clean Bootstrap design and an explainatory approach, beginners will
face a less challenging start to their machine learning experience.

### The project
This web application was made in Java using the [Springboot framework](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) and
[Weka API](https://waikato.github.io/weka-wiki/using_the_api/). Springboot is used
as a web controller while the Weka API was used to create machine learning
models.
